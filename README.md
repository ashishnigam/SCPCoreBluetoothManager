SCPCoreBluetoothManager
=======================

Block based wrapper around the Core Bluetooth framework.

Note this is only v1.0 and only includes the Central Manager part, the Peripheral Manager part is still in development.

Also note the demo uses cocoapods to include the SVProgressHUD dependency so you need to run the `pod install` command via terminal.
